# ExoDOSConverter

a custom game converter from the ExoDOS collection to emulation station based distribution format (Retropie, Recalbox, Batocera)

Rewriting of an old project into a more user friendly form, the aim is to fully support ExoDOS v5 and ExoWin3x v2 when they are released

Future features :
- fully debug generation of dosbox.bat
- implement GUI either in tkinter or Qt
